# README Generator

  ## Description
This application will run a series of prompts and collect data from the user. It will ask for description, installation, usage, license(s), contributing and tests. Once the necessary data is collected from the user as well as ways to contact if any questions arise. The application will then create a high quality README file for the user.

## Installation
Installation for this application began with installing node.js to my machine for the lectures for the week. I then had to make a repository for the current challenge. Once installed and given the starter code I had to make a .gitignore file and run npm i in an integrated terminal in VSCode. A package-lock.json was necessary for this application as well. Once everything was installed I had to write the necessary functions in both the index.js and generateMarkdown files. I had to cover all the necessary questions for the README file and call to that data later. Final product is a high quality README file.

## Usage
The intended usage for this application is to create a high quality README file for the user based off the information given and data retrieved. This is intended to simplify the process of creating this file in VSCode.

## Contributing
Honestly, not quite sure what to write here yet.. But get into coding and you can melt your brain daily.

## Tests
I can tell you one thing, always test your code. I'll modify this portion of the file once I do a bit more research on what belongs in this area.
